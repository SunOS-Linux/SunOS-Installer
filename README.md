<img src="https://github.com/Server2356/Sun-OS-Installer/blob/master/Sun:OS.png" />

This README contains the steps to do the install and configure a fully-functional Sun/OS installation containing a desktop environment, all the support packages (network, bluetooth, audio, printers, etc.), along with all applications and utilities. The shell scripts in this repo allow the entire process to be automated.) Sun/OS 2021.01.01 (Codename Waco) will be avaliable on December 30, 2020

## 1. Setup Boot and Sun/OS-archiso on USB key

First, setup the boot USB, boot Sun/OS-archiso live usb, and run the `preinstall.sh` from terminal since Sun/OS is based from Arch Linux.

### 2. Archiso-Sun/OS-2021.01.01 (Pre-Install)

This step installs Sun/OS to your hard drive. *IT WILL FORMAT THE DISK*

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Server2356/Sun-OS-Installer.git
sh preinstall.sh
and then run the follwoing commands below and create (vim arch.conf)
```

### 3. Sun/OS - Install internals of Sun/OS

```bash
pacman -S --no-confirm pacman-contrib curl git
git clone https://github.com/Server2356/Sun-OS-Installer.gitcd ArchMatic
./0-setup.sh
./1-base.sh
./2-software-pacman.sh
./3-software-aur.sh
./9-post-setup.sh
```
### 4. Creating root password
```bash
passwd root
password:"enter your password"
Confirm password:"Enter your password"
```
### 5. Create Arch.conf in /boot/loader/entries

As I mentioned before, create a new Vim file called Arch.conf and type the following:

```bash
Title Sun/OS
linux /vmlinuz-linux
initrd /initramfs-linux-.img
options root="UUID=/dev/sd(x) UUID goes here with the quotations" rw
```
### 6. Enablining the GNOME Desktop and starting it
```bash
systemctl enable gdm.service
exit
reboot
```
Once you done that, login to your new installation of Sun/OS and type the following command:
```bash
systemctl start gdm.service
```
And follow the instruction on setup at the following link

### System Description

To boot use `systemd` because it's minimalist, comes built-in, and since the Linux kernel has an EFI image, all we need is a way to execute it.

Also install the LTS Kernel* along side the rolling one, and configure the bootloader to offer both as a choice during startup. This enables me to switch kernels in the event of a problem with the rolling one.
*Update to the latest kernel --> Linux Kernel 5.10.1 LTS ---> Now supported on Sun/OS 2021.01.01

### Troubleshooting Arch Linux and Sun/OS

__[Arch Linux and Installation Gude](https://github.com/rickellis/Arch-Linux-Install-Guide)__

#### No Wifi

```bash
sudo wifi-menu`
```

#### Initialize Xorg:
At the terminal, run:

```bash
xinit
```
#### Updating
To update the system, run the command below in order for the system to update
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
```
Press y and press enter, and the update should install. Once the update is finished reboot your system and execute the "update.sh" file to update the system information, we will soon push a package for updating!
